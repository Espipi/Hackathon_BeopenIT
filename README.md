Predict flight delay base on United States Department of Transportation datasets

## Context
Air travel can be stressful due to many factors that are simply beyond the control of passengers. As passengers, we want to minimize this stress as much as possible. To do this, we can use past data to predict the probability of a delayed flight based on the time of day or the airline.

In this example, we use historical weather data from the station at Chicago O'Hare International Airport from 2013 to 2014.

## Objectives
1. Problem of data ingestion processes.
2. Using learning machine algorithms for prediction.
3. Use the machine learning model built to advise a customer who would like to make a trip to help him choose the flight.

## Datasets
1. Fights Dta
From the Bureau of Transporation Statistics’ On-Time-Performance data page (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236)
2. Weather Data
From the NOAA Climate Data Online: Dataset Discovery page (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets)
